Understand Toogethr groups
==========================

With the Toogethr app, you can both offer and request rides. Each ride includes a destination and departure date and time. It's quite likely that people going to for instance a soccer match, share rides to the stadium where the match is being held, and leaving all on the same day.

That's were Toogethr groups add value. Toogethr groups are bundling all the rides to the same destination. This makes it much easier to find rides not only to a specific location, but be assured you travel with other fans. And not people going to the shopping mall next door.

## Groups are powerful
Groups don't necessarily have to be linked to a specific location. For instance a group for windsurfers. Depending on the wind, windsurfers go to different spots. You want to be sure you travel with a fellow surfer. And probably, you want to bring your board along. Sunseekers quite often don't have this specific need.

Other groups do have a specific location, but not a set date. For example, your office is at a nice business park, 3 miles away from the nearest busstop. A group can help you to be notified when new rides are shared with your group. 

Quite likely, when you want to integrate carpooling on your website, Facebook page, blog, or forum: a Toogethr group is what you need to be set up.

## How to start a group?
Starting a group is easy. And it won't cost you anything. You have to request for a group. Toogethr support will handle your request to ensure the list of groups stay clean and relevant.

We assume you already have a Toogethr account. If not, create a Toogethr account first.

First search the list of Toogethr groups before you request a new group. Nothing out there? Feel free to start a new group. 

## Following a group
Once your group is set up, make sure you start following the group. That's very easy. Open the Toogethr group (for instance by following the link: https://m.toogethr.com/group/pinkpop) and tick the 'Follow' button. This ensures that you will remain in the loop of what's happening in your group.
