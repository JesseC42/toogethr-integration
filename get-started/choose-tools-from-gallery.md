Whether you have a website, blog, forum, or Facebook page, there are several ways to integrate with Toogethr:

* [Widgets](#widgets)
* [Deep link](#deep-link)
* [Banner](#banner)
* [Facebook page tab app](#facebook-page-tab-app)
 
## Widgets
A widget brings the Toogethr content and services directly to your webpage. Your visitors will be able to view, search or post rides directly from your own website.

You are probably familiar with YouTube videos that are all over the web. Or the Facebook Like button. These are all widgets. It's just some lines of code (called JavaScript) you publish on your webpage. And we take care of the rest.

There are several widget types you can choose from: for instance to directly lists all rides shared with the group. Each widget can be further customized to seamlessly integrate with your page. Detailed information about the widgets can be found in the [Documentation](documentation/documentation-overview/).

Make sure you have read and agreed with the [Widget Terms of Use](http://terms.toogethr.com/) before you publish a widget.

## Deep link
A deep link will redirect your site visitors directly to a group homepage in the Toogethr app. It's advised to publish such as link on the ‘Location’, ‘Route’ or ‘Traffic’ section of your website.  

Toogethr can provide a short URL for the deep link upon request (link stuurt een e-mail). For example http://lift.je/naarpinkpop. This is especially useful in offline/printed media.

## Banner
Deep links can be strenghtened by placing a visual image. Add an image to the link to create a banner that redirects the website visitor to your own carpool group.
