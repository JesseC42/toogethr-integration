Get started with integration
============================

There are several ways to integrate Toogethr with your website or Facebook page. Before we look into the various possibilities, you first need to know the basics: the concept of Toogethr groups. A group brings together people with similar interests or destinations, willing to share rides with each other. For instance a Toogethr group for the [Pinkpop music festival](https://m.toogethr.com/group/pinkpop). A group for [kitesurfers](https://m.toogethr.com/group/kitesurf-fone). A group for people in the [Rotterdam region](https://m.toogethr.com/group/rotterdam-centrum).
