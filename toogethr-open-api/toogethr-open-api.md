Toogethr Open API
=================

The Toogethr Open API is there for advanced integrations with the Toogethr platform. We believe that being part of the transition called the Sharing Economy, it's important to open up our services and data, and share what we have. Helping people with creative ideas to provide value on top of what we have done so far. 

## Access to the Open API
Consider the Toogethr Open API an MVP for now.  It's available, but not yet to everyone. [Contact us](mailto:info@toogethr.com), as we love to hear what you have in mind.

## Terms of the Toogethr Open API
The Toogethr Open API comes with its own [legal terms](http://terms.toogethr.com/). It won't come free of charge. For a limited number of monthly calls, there will be a free plan. Above this threshold, a monthly fee does apply. Why? Because we rely on third party services that needs to be paid for as well. And so does our cloud hosting provider.
