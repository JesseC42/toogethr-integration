Documentation overview
======================

This section provides technical information on how to integrate with Toogethr. First of all, get yourself familiar with the basics through the Get started section.

In this section, the following types of integration are outlined:

## Widgets
Widgets are small pieces of HTML/Javascript code that you embed in your website and that show specific things from your Toogethr group.

We have made the following Widget types available:

* Group rides widget: This widget let you show rides that are shared within that group.
* Group counter widget: This widget uses less space, and just shows the number of new rides available within that group.
* Group activities widgets: This widget shows user activities in that group.

Each widget can be further customized in size and behavior in order to fit on your website.

## Deep link
Deep links allow you to open Toogethr Group pages directly from your website.

Each group has its own URL. For instance https://m.toogethr.com/group/pinkpop. This is a deep link into the Toogethr app for getting directly to the group homepage.

If the location and/or dates are specified, this information will be populated in the form fields.

The last part of the URL is called the key-name of the group. In the above example it's "pinkpop". The key-name is unique and is needed to integrate a widget from you website to the Toogethr app.

## Facebook page tab app
You can easily add a Toogethr Group as a Facebook tab to your Facebook page. Your Toogethr group will appear as tab besides your other tabs.
