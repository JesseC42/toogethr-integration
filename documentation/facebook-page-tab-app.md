Facebook Page tab app
=====================

A group can be added as a tab to your Facebook Page. This means that users in your community will be able to quickly discover your Toogethr Group and see all shared rides.

## Requirements

* Your Toogethr account must be linked to Facebook. If this is not the case, you can connect to Facebook inside the Profile Settings page.
* You must be administrator of the Facebook page. 
* It must indeed be a Facebook page that you wish to add the tab to, not a person, event or group on Facebook. 

## How to add the Facebook Tab app

1. Follow the Toogethr group you want to add as new tab.
2. In the specific Toogethr group you wish to add to your Facebook page, go to the settings menu. There you will find a button named 'Add this group to a Facebook page' to add the group to one of your Facebook pages.
3. Once you click this button, a Facebook dialog will appear that asks you to select a page. 
4. On submit, a new tab will be added to your Facebook page named 'Carpool'. This tab contains the Toogethr app.
5. Now your community users will be able to directly open the Toogethr Group from your Facebook Page
